You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **React** - dinos interactive with clicks
- **Service** - The API I am going to use is AnimeFacts because why not. Dinosaurs would make a great anime
- **DB/Login** - person can login so that they can record their dino songs and so they can vote.
